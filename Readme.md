You can test module ping by entring:
   ```sh
   $ ansible nginx -i inventory/inventory.ini -m ping
   ```
If you create ansible.cfg file for example:

   ```
      [defaults]
      inventory = inventory/inventory.ini
      stdout_callback = yaml
      callback_enable = timer
   ```
   ```sh
   $ ansible nginx -m ping
   ```
You can execute arbitrary commands with the `command` module
If you want tou pass an argument to module with the '-a' flag
   ```sh
   $ ansible nginx -m command -a uptime
   ```
If you need privileged access, pass in the `-b` or `--become` flag

    # -k, --ask-pass: ask for connection password
    # -K, --ask-become-pass: ask for privilege escalation password

   ```sh
   $ ansible nginx -b -K -a "tail /var/log/dmesg" 
   ```
You can install Midnight Commander on Ubuntu by using the following command:
   ```sh
   $ ansible nginx -b -K -m package -a name=mc
   ```
Use `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` file to create virtual environment
   ```sh
   $ docker-compose up -d
   ```
you can use yamllint to find typos in YAML that you wonâ€™t find when you use the string format.
   ```sh
   $ yamllint <playbook.yml>
   ```
Ansible ships with the ansible-doc command-line tool
   ```sh
   $ ansible-doc <module-name>
   ```
## Usage
  * **Plays**

Looking at the YAML, it should be clear that a playbook is a list of dictionaries. 
Specifically, a playbook is a list of plays. 
Think of a play as the thing that connects to a group of hosts and a list of things to do on those hosts for you. 


* **Modules**

Modules are scripts that come packaged with Ansible and perform some kind of action on a host. 
Ansible executes a task on a host by generating a custom script based on the module name and arguments, 
and then copies this script to the host and runs it.
